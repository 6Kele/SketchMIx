For those who like drawing drawabox is a helpful tool which gives you a lot of the basics and fundamentals of drawing. Each of them having a bunch of exercises to go with it. 
It is generally recommened for you to not completely forget exercises and choose a select few random ones before drawing in order for you to warm up and practice the fundamentals.This tool just simply helps with that as it will randomly select 3 exercises for you to do.

I will add more including other exercises from other sources and possible a random drawing of the day for a person to do.
